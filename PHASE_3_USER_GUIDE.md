## 🎓 How to Train Your AI

### Building a Strong Profile

**Rate Diverse Movies (10-20 ratings)**
```
✅ Rate movies you LOVE (5 stars)
✅ Rate movies you LIKE (4 stars)
✅ Rate movies you're NEUTRAL about (3 stars)
✅ Rate movies you DISLIKE (1-2 stars)

Why? The AI learns what you DO and DON'T like!
```

**Be Honest**
```
Don't rate movies you haven't seen
Rate based on YOUR taste, not critics
The more honest, the better the recommendations
```

**Rate Across Genres**
```
If you like both Action AND Romance:
- Rate action movies you love
- Rate romance movies you love
- The AI will find movies mixing both!
```

## 🔍 Understanding the Badges

### 🤖 AI Match Badge
```

Meaning: Based on movie features (genres, cast, plot)
How it works: TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
```

### 👤 Personal Match Badge
```
Example: "👤 +15% personal match"
Meaning: Bonus for matching your preferences
How it works: Your ratings → genre/director preferences → boost
```

### Combined Power
```
Movie A: 🤖 80% match
Movie B: 🤖 60% match + 👤 +20% personal match
→ Movie B is better FOR YOU (60% + 20% = 80% + personal fit!)
